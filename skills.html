  <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
    Whether managing inventory across multiple outlets or analyzing synthetic retail data,
    my approach always starts with clarity — understanding the problem, simplifying the process,
    and using data to support every decision. Over time, I’ve learned that the best systems are built
    by combining operational logic with analytical thinking.

  <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 1.05rem;">
    I enjoy connecting dots between business goals and data patterns — automating what’s repetitive,
    improving what’s inconsistent, and making insights simple enough for everyone in the room to act on.
    Below is a look at how I usually operate, both in mindset and in method.

      <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.6;">
        I use <strong>Python</strong> for data analysis, feature engineering, and light automation.
        <strong>Power BI</strong> and <strong>Excel</strong> help me translate data into dashboards and
        operational reports that guide procurement and stock decisions.
        I’m currently experimenting with <strong>Flask</strong> apps and AI workflows to automate
        insights for retail operations.

      <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.6;">
        My foundation comes from the floor — managing vendors, negotiating terms, tracking stock movements,
        and forecasting demand. That experience shaped how I view data today:
        numbers mean little unless they solve a real business pain point like
        <strong>overstocking, vendor delays, or forecasting errors</strong>.
      </p>

    <!-- Analytical Thinking -->

      <h3 style="color: var(--text-heading); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Analytical Thinking</h3>
      <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.6;">
        Every dataset, synthetic or real, tells a story.
        I prefer exploring trends patiently, identifying what’s actionable, and presenting it
        in a way decision-makers can quickly relate to.
        My goal isn’t to impress with complexity — it’s to make analytics feel
        like a practical extension of business sense.

    <!-- Collaboration -->

      <h3 style="color: var(--text-heading); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Collaboration & Communication</h3>
      <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.6;">
        I value clear, transparent communication.
        Whether I’m aligning with a pharmacist, a warehouse team, or a data analyst,
        I focus on keeping discussions actionable and time-efficient.
        I believe people work best when they feel understood, not instructed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Languages -->
    <div>
      <h3 style="color: var(--text-heading); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Languages & Culture</h3>
      <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.6;">
        I work comfortably in <strong>English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada</strong>,
        and basic <strong>Malayalam</strong>.  
        Living and working across India and the UAE taught me to adapt quickly —
        to read contexts, not just words — which helps in cross-team coordination
        and understanding business dynamics beyond numbers.

  <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 2.5rem; font-size: 1.05rem;">
    At this stage in my career, I’m blending operational experience with structured analytics.
    My aim is to move toward AI-driven business strategy — building systems that not only report what happened,
    but also guide what should happen next.
