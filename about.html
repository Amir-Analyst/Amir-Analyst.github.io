  <div class="card-content" style="line-height: 1.8;">

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      I'm <strong>Amir Khan</strong> — a Data analyst in transition from operational management to <strong>AI-driven business analytics and strategy</strong>.  
      With over a decade of experience across <strong>pharma sales, purchasing, and inventory management</strong> in the UAE and India, 
      I’ve seen firsthand how everyday operational inefficiencies can be transformed into data problems — and how intelligence can make business scalable.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      My journey began as a <strong>Medical Representative</strong> in India, where I learned how market dynamics, psychology, and data intersect in real-world sales decisions.  
      After moving to the UAE, I spent over five years in <strong>pharmacy purchasing and inventory operations</strong>, managing vendor relations, demand forecasting, and supply optimization.  
      These roles gave me a practical understanding of how business systems work — and how data analytics can elevate decision-making.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      I’m currently pursuing my <strong>Bachelor of Business Administration</strong> at Manipal University Jaipur and plan to continue with an <strong>MBA in AI-Driven Business Strategy</strong>.  
      To complement this academic path, I’ve completed professional certifications in <strong>Google Advanced Data Analytics</strong>, <strong>IBM AI Engineering</strong>, and <strong>IBM Generative AI Engineering</strong>, 
      equipping me to bridge business operations with intelligent automation and analytical insight.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: var(--accent-cyan);">Current Focus</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      I’m currently working on a self-initiated applied analytics project titled <strong>BlueMart Retail Analytics</strong> —  
      a simulated omnichannel retail business where I’ve <strong>generated a synthetic dataset</strong> representing store, channel, and product-level operations.  
      The goal is to perform <strong>exploratory data analysis</strong>, extract actionable <strong>business insights</strong>, and provide <strong>recommendations</strong> on improving sales forecasting, 
      inventory balance, and multi-channel efficiency.  
      This project reflects my focus on <strong>real-world analytics application</strong> rather than theoretical exercises.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: var(--accent-cyan);">Vision</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      My long-term goal is to become an <strong>AI-driven business strategist</strong> — someone who can combine data intelligence, business acumen, and behavioral understanding 
      to design adaptive, automated decision systems.  
      I aim to help organizations transition from manual reporting to <strong>self-learning business models</strong> that think, predict, and improve continuously.
